# Assignment 4 — Deploy EpicBook Application on AWS Using Terraform

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to provision AWS network infrastructure (VPC, public/private subnets, Security Groups), launch an Ubuntu 22.04 EC2 instance, and provision a private Amazon RDS for MySQL instance. You will then deploy EpicBook, connect it to MySQL, and validate the complete user flow.

---

# Task 1 — Create Network Infrastructure with Terraform

## Goal

Define a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with a public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) and private subnet (10.0.2.0/24), an Internet Gateway with public routing, an EC2 Security Group (SSH 22, HTTP 80), and an RDS Security Group (MySQL 3306 only from the EC2 Security Group).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terraform configuration showing the VPC and both subnet CIDR ranges

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Terraform configuration showing the Internet Gateway, public route table, and both Security Groups

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 2 — Provision EC2 Virtual Machine (Ubuntu 22.04)

## Goal

Use Terraform to launch a t2.micro Ubuntu 22.04 EC2 instance in the public subnet with a public IP, then install Node.js, npm, Git, Nginx, and MySQL client.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Terraform apply output showing successful EC2 provisioning

Add your screenshot here.

#### Screenshot 4 — EC2 instance running in the AWS Console with the public IP and subnet visible

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 3 — Deploy the EpicBook Application

## Goal

Deploy the EpicBook frontend and backend on the EC2 instance and configure Nginx to serve it, following the Installation, Configuration & Troubleshooting Guide.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing the EpicBook application files and dependency installation

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Terminal showing the application and Nginx services running

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 4 — Set Up Amazon RDS for MySQL with Terraform

## Goal

Provision a private Amazon RDS MySQL instance (db.t3.micro, Publicly accessible: false) restricted to the EC2 Security Group, then initialize the database using the provided SQL dump and connect the EpicBook backend to it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terraform apply output showing successful RDS provisioning

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 9 — RDS instance in the AWS Console showing the private network configuration and Publicly accessible: No

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Terminal showing successful database initialization or table verification from EC2

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Test End-to-End Functionality

## Goal

Confirm EpicBook is accessible through the EC2 public IP and that navigation, cart, order summary, and checkout all work against the MySQL backend.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — Browser showing the EpicBook application through the EC2 public IP

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Browser showing a working product, cart, order summary, or checkout flow

Add your screenshot here.
